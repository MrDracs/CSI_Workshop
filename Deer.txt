A deer is a beautiful animal with a long, slender body and four legs. It has a white or brown coat with black spots, and a long, thin tail. Deer are fast runners and can jump high. They live in forests and fields, and eat leaves, grass, and other plants. They are very shy and quiet, and they communicate with each other using soft sounds called "whispers." Deer are important to the natural world because they help keep the plants and trees healthy by eating their leaves. They are also a symbol of grace and beauty.
